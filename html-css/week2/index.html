                <div><h3>Web development as an industry</h3>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>It was made popular less than a couple of decades ago. The web industry is one of the most
                        profitable business in the modern world. The industry that is known for its web development has
                        created a world where information is abundance and available for anyone, anywhere and anytime.

                <div>
                    <p>Beside being one of the youngest and the most profitable, web development has been one of the
                        fastest growing industries in the world since the mid-1990s. In 1995 there were fewer than 1,000
                        web development companies in the United States, but by 2005 there were a massive increase to
                        over 30,000 of such companies in the U.S. alone. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The growth of this industry is main caused by the demand of large businesses wishing to sell
                        products and services to their customers and to automate business workflow.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Web development is a term for the work involved in developing a website for the internet (World
                        Wide Web) or an intranet (private network). This can include web design, web content
                        development, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration,
                        and e-commerce development. However, among web professionals, "web development" usually refers
                        to the main non-design aspects of building websites: writing markup and coding. Web development
                        can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex
                        web-based internet applications, electronic businesses (e-commerce), or social network services.
