            <p>I like what I'm doing now. It's all about design and coding.
             I feel so powerful, just think I was starting from scratch and then this full backend and frontend stuff. 
             I don't want to list all programs and languages... BUT I will try it. 
             Here I used JavaScript, CSS, MySQL, PostMan, and Node.js </p>
